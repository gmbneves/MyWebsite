Hi! My name is Gabriel Mattos Baeta Neves. I'm currently a graduate student in the Economics Graduate Program at the Federal University of Paraíba (PPGE - UFPB). My research is focused on labor economics and economics of education.

This website is under construction. My goal here is to build an academic website that shows a little a bit of my - still very brief - career and blog about my research and other interests.

Feel free to contact me or follow me on my social media by clicking on the respective icon below.
